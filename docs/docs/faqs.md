#### **What is the NOC Data Science Platform?**

The NOC Data Science Platform (**DSP**) provides easy access to compute resources including Python, Matlab, Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and Unix terminals all from your web browser and without the need to install anything on your computer.

The system is maintained by the NOC Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Group.

#### **Do I need an account to access the NOC Data Science Platform?**

Yes, you will first need a NOC Southampton Unix account to connect to the **DSP** and then will need to apply for **NOC DSP** access.

Please go to the **NOC DSP** [**Intranet page**](https://nocacuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DigitalOcean/SitePages/Data-Science-Platform.aspx?source=FromArticle#how-do-i-get-access) for details on how to get an account ahead of the Hackathon event.

#### **Can I participate by using my laptop?**

Yes, you can use your personal machine to work through the tutorial and example notebooks since NOC NPD data is available via the cloud (i.e., you only need to be able to access the internet to stream outputs to your machine).

See the [Getting Started] page for further instructions on the steps to set-up the virtual environment and Jupyter kernel on your personal machine.

#### **Can I participate on [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk)?**

Yes, you can use either the [JASMIN Notebook Service](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/interactive-computing/jasmin-notebooks-service/) or interactive Sci machines to work through the tutorial and example notebooks since NOC NPD data is available via the cloud (i.e., you only need to be able to access the internet to stream outputs to your machine).

See the [Getting Started] page for further instructions on the steps to set-up the virtual environment and Jupyter kernel on JASMIN.
