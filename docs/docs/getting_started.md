# Getting Started

To participate in the hands-on tutorials and get started exploring the outputs of the NOC Near-Present Day simulations, you need to choose a platform to perform your analysis. 

Below, we provide instructions for getting started on the National Oceanography Centre's Data Science Platform (**DSP**), [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) or your own personal machine. 

We strongly recommend participants use the NOC DSP, given that we have already prepared a shared Python virtual environment which contains all of the required packages for the hackathon.

## Using the NOC Data Science Platform

To get started using the NOC DSP:

```python
